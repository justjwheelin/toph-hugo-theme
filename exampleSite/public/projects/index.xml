      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clark was born on May 3, 1898 to an American slave father and a free Haitian mother.&#xA;From an early point in her life, her parents pushed Clark to pursue an education.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“When we were children, the one thing [my father] wanted was for us to have an education.&#xA;This was the only thing that I know he would whip you for:&#xA;if you didn’t want to go to school.&#xA;There were times we didn’t want to go.&#xA;I cried one morning I didn’t want to go to that school, and he whipped me with a strap and then took me down there”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a political organizer, activist, and teacher in the Jim Crow South, Septima Clark overcame deceptive tactics to destroy racial coalitions like the NAACP.&#xA;In 1954, Clark lost her teaching role and pension in South Carolina because of her role as the Charleston NAACP&#xA;membership chair (Neumann).&#xA;The South Carolina state legislature passed a law that no city or state employee could affiliate with a Civil Rights organization.&#xA;Instead of keeping her job and renouncing membership, Clark refused to renounce her membership.&#xA;But while some groups actively antagonized Civil Rights Movement leaders and organizers, others did attempt to help.&#xA;But this was through the clumsiness of allies with good intentions but missing context.&#xA;This was characterized in Clark’s connection with a South Carolina justice, Judge Waring, and his second wife, Elizabeth Waring.&#xA;They were controversial as one of the few (or possibly only) White family in Charleston to speak up against segregation and racism.&#xA;However, there are moments where Clark reflects on knowing her allies do not fully understand her or her community’s life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The impact of Septima Clark and her work is often considered through her students.&#xA;Her methods of public intervention were predominantly nonviolent (&lt;em&gt;Neumann&lt;/em&gt;).&#xA;She also believed in empowerment through education.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her early role as a leader in creating Citizenship Schools enabled others to follow her precedent.&#xA;She prepared a network of grassroots teachers in week-long training sessions on topics like how to recruit students, gauge educational levels, and develop lesson plans.&#xA;She also ensured students were taught essential information like location and hours of the voter registration office and what health care and employment opportunities were available in their communities (&lt;em&gt;Charron-Cline&lt;/em&gt;).&#xA;Clark kept her Citizenship Schools curriculum relevant and updated to contemporary developments in the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
