== Who am I

My name is Septima Poinsette Clark (May 3, 1898 â€“ December 15, 1987).
I was an African American educator and civil rights activist.
I strongly believe that knowledge can empower marginalized groups in ways that formal legal equality cannot.


== What I do

I developed the literacy and citizenship workshops that played an important role in the drive for voting rights and civil rights for African Americans in the Civil Rights Movement.
I was known as the "Queen mother" or "Grandmother" of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.
Martin Luther King Jr. commonly referred to me as "The Mother of the Movement".
