The impact of Septima Clark and her work is often considered through her students.
Her methods of public intervention were predominantly nonviolent (_Neumann_).
She also believed in empowerment through education.

Her early role as a leader in creating Citizenship Schools enabled others to follow her precedent.
She prepared a network of grassroots teachers in week-long training sessions on topics like how to recruit students, gauge educational levels, and develop lesson plans.
She also ensured students were taught essential information like location and hours of the voter registration office and what health care and employment opportunities were available in their communities (_Charron-Cline_).
Clark kept her Citizenship Schools curriculum relevant and updated to contemporary developments in the Civil Rights Movement.

> “Training sessions and teaching classes afforded grassroots African American women the opportunity to evaluate the local problems they deemed most important while the Movement itself provided a vehicle for addressing them.”

In this unique way, Clark’s impact goes beyond herself, but also to the many students who were taught under her leadership, and then returned to teach citizenship skills in their communities.
This is also why she is sometimes left out of the retelling of history because her role was often behind the scenes and not visible.
But she was a foundational piece of the Civil Rights Movement as an educator and Black woman leader (even if she viewed her gender as a separate matter from her race instead of from an intersectional point-of-view).
Her role chain-amplified the growth of more decentralized leadership for the Civil Rights Movement at the local level in neighborhoods and Black communities.
