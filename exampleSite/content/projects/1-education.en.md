Clark was born on May 3, 1898 to an American slave father and a free Haitian mother.
From an early point in her life, her parents pushed Clark to pursue an education.

> “When we were children, the one thing [my father] wanted was for us to have an education.
> This was the only thing that I know he would whip you for:
> if you didn’t want to go to school.
> There were times we didn’t want to go.
> I cried one morning I didn’t want to go to that school, and he whipped me with a strap and then took me down there”

One thing that stood out to Clark as a Black student in the 1910s was the lack of Black teachers to teach children.
Many segregated schools had white teachers teaching black children.
This also led to Clark’s first experience with political organizing in 1919:

> “So we had to do a door-to-door thing to get black teachers to teach their children.
> And in 1920 we got them.
> Oh, that thing had been coming a long time, but we hadn’t gotten to the place where we felt as if we could get the signatures before.
> I took my students along with me, and we got these signatures.
> Some would be across the street, and then I’d do it on the other side, and that’s how we did it”
>
> _Charron-Cline_

Ultimately, Clark was pushed towards education at an early age and soon realized the political power that education affords.
This was a formational experience in her political activist career.
