As a political organizer, activist, and teacher in the Jim Crow South, Septima Clark overcame deceptive tactics to destroy racial coalitions like the NAACP.
In 1954, Clark lost her teaching role and pension in South Carolina because of her role as the Charleston NAACP
membership chair (Neumann).
The South Carolina state legislature passed a law that no city or state employee could affiliate with a Civil Rights organization.
Instead of keeping her job and renouncing membership, Clark refused to renounce her membership.
But while some groups actively antagonized Civil Rights Movement leaders and organizers, others did attempt to help.
But this was through the clumsiness of allies with good intentions but missing context.
This was characterized in Clark’s connection with a South Carolina justice, Judge Waring, and his second wife, Elizabeth Waring.
They were controversial as one of the few (or possibly only) White family in Charleston to speak up against segregation and racism.
However, there are moments where Clark reflects on knowing her allies do not fully understand her or her community’s life.

> “To be unmercifully truthful, I don’t really feel that Mrs. Waring had that much knowledge of the life of blacks.
> It was Judge Waring’s influence on her—that’s what I think—that imparted to her the fact that "I would like to change things."
> She was like my mother, very high-strung, and very angry over things.
> She got angry with me when I said that she was vitriolic.
> She didn’t like that. But it was true”

Despite the challenges of interracial relationships, Clark realized that all women were empowered through the role of teaching.
This became a grounding aspect of her activism and enabled her to link her activism with civic duty and organization.
The curriculum of her courses focused on learning to read and write in order to pass literacy tests, how to create a household budget, how to balance a checkbook, and how to apply for Social Security benefits (_Charron-Cline_).
Her teaching was a vehicle for her to help other woman gain greater autonomy and independence of their own lives.

> “First, when compared to losing one’s job, facing eviction from a white landlord, or risking one’s life by participating in direct action campaigns, teaching adults to read and write appeared a relatively safe entry point into the Movement.”

Ultimately, despite these challenges and setbacks, Septima Clark was able to persist and continue her teaching through the Civil Rights period, even if it required relocating across the Southeast a couple of times.
